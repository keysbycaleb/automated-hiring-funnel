        <h1>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h1>
        <h2>Exhibit B to Master Service Agreement</h2>

        <p>This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") outlines the specific levels of service, support, and maintenance provided by Lanting Digital LLC ("Provider") to <strong>[Client Legal Name]</strong> ("Client") for Subscription Services engaged under the Master Service Agreement ("MSA") dated <strong>[MSA Effective Date]</strong> and the relevant Statement of Work ("SOW") dated <strong>[SOW Effective Date]</strong>.</p>

        <p>This SLA applies only during the active term of a Subscription Service SOW.</p>

        <h2>1. Included Maintenance Services</h2>
        <p>Provider will perform the following routine maintenance services for the Client's hosted website/application covered under the Subscription Service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Apply necessary updates and patches to the core Content Management System (CMS), themes, plugins, or underlying server software ([e.g., monthly, quarterly]).</li>
            <li><strong>Security Monitoring & Hardening:</strong> Employ reasonable measures to monitor for and protect against common security threats. ([Describe briefly, e.g., basic firewall, malware scans]).</li>
            <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Perform regular backups of the website/application data ([e.g., daily, weekly]) with a defined retention period ([e.g., 14 days]).</li>
            <li><strong>Uptime Monitoring:</strong> Provider will monitor the general availability of the hosted service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Included Support Services</h2>
        <p>Provider will provide technical support related to the functioning of the hosted website/application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Support Channels:</strong> Support requests may be submitted via [e.g., Email to support@lantingdigital.com, Client Portal Link].</li>
            <li><strong>Support Hours:</strong> Support is available [e.g., Monday - Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Pacific Time], excluding Provider holidays.</li>
            <li><strong>Included Support Time:</strong> The subscription fee includes up to <strong>[e.g., 1 hour]</strong> of support time per month for minor content updates (e.g., text changes, image swaps), bug fixes related to included maintenance, or general inquiries. Unused time does not roll over.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Support:</strong> Work exceeding the included monthly time, or work related to new features, major design changes, or third-party integrations not covered by the original SOW, will be considered outside the scope of this SLA and will require a separate quote or SOW at Provider's then-current hourly rate ([e.g., $100/hour]).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Response Time Targets</h2>
        <p>Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to acknowledge receipt of support requests submitted through the designated channels within the following timeframes during Support Hours:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Critical Issues (e.g., Website/Application Down):</strong> Target acknowledgement within [e.g., 2-4] business hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Issues (e.g., Minor bug, Content update request):</strong> Target acknowledgement within [e.g., 1] business day.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>Acknowledgement means confirming receipt of the request and potentially providing an initial assessment or request for more information. Resolution times will vary based on the complexity of the issue.</i></p>

        <h2>4. Service Availability (Uptime) - If Hosting Included</h2>
        <p>Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the hosted Subscription Service is available [e.g., 99.5%] of the time each calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance windows and circumstances beyond Provider's reasonable control (Force Majeure, Client-caused issues, third-party network failures).</p>
        <p>Scheduled maintenance will be performed during low-traffic hours ([e.g., typically between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM Pacific Time]) whenever possible, with advance notice provided for significant updates.</p>
        <p><i>(Optional: Define remedies if uptime target is missed, e.g., service credits. Keep it simple to start).</i></p>

        <h2>5. Exclusions</h2>
        <p>This SLA does not cover issues arising from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client modifications to the website/application code or server settings.</li>
            <li>Improper use of the website/application by Client or its users.</li>
            <li>Failures of third-party software, services, or APIs not directly managed by Provider (unless their maintenance is explicitly included in the SOW).</li>
            <li>Client hardware, software, or network connectivity issues.</li>
            <li>Development of new features or significant enhancements beyond routine maintenance and included support time.</li>
            <li>Training, content creation, graphic design, or SEO services unless specified in the SOW.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Modifications</h2>
        <p>Provider reserves the right to update this SLA upon [e.g., 30 days'] written notice to Client. Continued use of the Subscription Service after such notice constitutes acceptance of the updated SLA.</p>
        
        <p><i>This SLA is referenced by and forms part of the Master Service Agreement.</i></p>
